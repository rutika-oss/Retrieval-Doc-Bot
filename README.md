# 📄 RetrievalDocBot – RAG Based PDF Chatbot

An AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that enables intelligent question answering from uploaded PDF documents using semantic search and large language models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

RetrievalDocBot allows users to upload multiple PDF files and ask context-aware questions.
The system retrieves relevant document chunks using vector similarity search and generates accurate answers strictly based on the uploaded content.

This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end RAG pipeline using LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Upload up to 10 PDF documents
- 🔍 Semantic search using FAISS
- 🤖 Context-based answer generation using OpenAI LLM
- 📊 Document statistics (Total pages, files, characters)
- 💬 Interactive chat interface (Streamlit)
- 📋 Copy response feature
- ⬇ Download full chat history
- 🗑 Clear chat functionality
- ⚙ Adjustable model parameters (Temperature & Max Tokens)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Technology    | Purpose                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Python        | Backend Logic               |
| Streamlit     | Web Interface               |
| LangChain     | RAG Pipeline                |
| OpenAI API    | LLM & Embeddings            |
| FAISS         | Vector Similarity Search    |
| pdfplumber    | PDF Text Extraction         |

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User uploads PDF documents.
2. Text is extracted using pdfplumber.
3. Text is split into chunks using LangChain.
4. OpenAI embeddings convert chunks into vectors.
5. FAISS stores vectors for semantic retrieval.
6. Relevant chunks are retrieved using MMR search.
7. Retrieved context is passed to GPT model.
8. Model generates an accurate answer based only on provided context.
